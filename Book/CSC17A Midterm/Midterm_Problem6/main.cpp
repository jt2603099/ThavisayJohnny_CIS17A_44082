 * a)  Convert the following 2 numbers to binary, octal and hex.
            2.875, 0.1796875
            When done, convert the following to a float representation
            by the definition in class. In other words, I want an 8 digit hex 
            number representation using the 4 byte float specification
            defined in class. An example .pdf is attached for you to review. 
       b)  Do the same for a) given they are negative values.
       c)  Convert the float representations of the following into 
            the decimal number given the definition in class.
            59999901, 59999902, A66667FE

    Note:  This doesn't require a program, however, I want you to write a 
    simple function that outputs the answers you did by hand with "cout".
