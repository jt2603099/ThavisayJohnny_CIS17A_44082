 * Develop an application using an array of structures that will 
    determine the gross pay for any number of employees input. The company pays 
    "straight-time" for the first 40 hours worked, double time for 
    all hours worked in excess of 40 hours but less than 50 hours, 
    and triple time for any hours worked over 50 hours.

    The program should be able to loop and input the employee's name, 
    hours worked, and the rate of pay.  Once this has been done then output
    this information including the gross pay in the form of a paycheck.
    The process starts all over 
    again until you input an invalid rate of pay or hours worked.  This
    means a negative rate of pay or negative number of hours worked is
    not acceptable.

    Print it out like an actual paycheck with English
    language representing the check amount.
    Prinout like a company Paycheck with format:
     Company
     Address
     Name:	Amount: numerical
     Amount:    English of numerical value
